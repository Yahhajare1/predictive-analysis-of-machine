Predictive maintanence Predictive maintanence is the maintanence of machines at a predicted future time before the machine failure. This allows scheduled maintanence of the machines, reducing the unplanned downtime costs.  In this notebook, we will build a deployable end-to-end classification model to predict whether a machine failure will occur or not. We will train state-of-the-art and compare their performances.
